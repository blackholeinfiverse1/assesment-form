# Field-Based Assessment System Documentation

## Overview

The assessment system has been completely reworked to replace AI-generated questions with hardcoded, field-specific questions. This new system provides:

- **Instant question generation** - No more waiting for AI processing
- **Field-specific questions** - Questions tailored to student study fields
- **Admin question management** - Full CRUD capabilities for question banks
- **Reliable scoring** - Direct evaluation without AI dependencies
- **Better performance** - Faster load times and consistent results

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Study Fields Configuration** (`src/data/studyFields.js`)
   - Defines 6 main study fields: STEM, Business, Social Sciences, Health & Medicine, Creative Arts, Other

4. **Updated Scoring Service** (`src/lib/scoringService.js`)
   - Direct evaluation using predefined correct answers
   - Sophisticated scoring algorithm for explanations and reasoning
   - No AI dependencies - faster and more reliable
   - Detailed feedback generation based on performance patterns

5. **Question Bank Manager** (`src/components/QuestionBankManager.jsx`)
   - Admin interface for managing question banks
   - Full CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete questions
   - Search and filter capabilities
