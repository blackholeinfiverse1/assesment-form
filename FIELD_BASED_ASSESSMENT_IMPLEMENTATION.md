# Field-Based Assessment System Implementation

## üéØ Overview
We've successfully implemented a comprehensive field-based assessment system that personalizes the student experience from intake to assignment based on their study field (STEM, Business, Social Sciences, Health & Medicine, Creative Arts, or Other).

## üîÑ Complete User Flow

### 1. Background Selection (New)
- **When**: First time users access `/intake` or `/assignment`
- **What**: Modal asking for:
  - Field of Study (STEM, Business, etc.)
  - Education Level (High School, Undergraduate, etc.)
  - Learning Goals (Skill building, Career change, etc.)
- **Storage**: `background_selections` table in Supabase
- **Purpose**: Enables precise field detection and personalized forms

### 2. Field-Specific Intake Form
- **When**: After background selection, user proceeds to `/intake`
- **What**: Dynamic form generated based on selected field
  - STEM students get programming languages, math level, technical interests
  - Business students get business areas, experience level, industry interests
  - Arts students get creative mediums, portfolio status, artistic goals
  - etc.
- **Storage**: `students` table with responses in JSONB format

### 3. Field-Based Assignment Generation
- **When**: User completes intake and goes to `/assignment`
- **What**: Questions selected based on detected field:
  1. **Admin Questions First**: Field-mapped questions from Question Bank
  2. **AI Generation**: If insufficient admin questions, Groq generates more
  3. **AI Persistence**: Generated questions stored in Question Bank for admin review
  4. **Field Mapping**: All questions mapped to the student's field

### 4. Assignment Completion & Storage
- **When**: Student completes assignment
- **What**: Detailed results stored in `assignment_attempts` and `assignment_responses`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **`students`** - Student profiles and intake responses
- **`background_selections`** - Field/class/goal selections
- **`form_configurations`** - Dynamic intake forms
- **`study_fields`** - Available fields with question weights
- **`question_banks`** - All questions (admin + AI generated)
- **`question_field_mapping`** - Maps questions to study fields
- **`assignment_attempts`** - Assignment results
- **`assignment_responses`** - Detailed question responses

### Key Features
- **Idempotent Setup**: SQL script can be run multiple times safely
- **Development-Friendly RLS**: Allows AI question generation from frontend
- **Comprehensive Indexes**: Optimized for performance
- **Question Usage Stats**: Tracks question performance over time

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### Question Generation Strategy
1. **Priority 1**: Admin-curated questions mapped to the student's field
2. **Priority 2**: General admin questions for the primary category
3. **Priority 3**: AI-generated questions using Groq API
4. **Fallback**: Curated question bank from code

### AI Question Persistence
- Generated questions stored in `question_banks` with `created_by='ai'`
- Automatically mapped to student's field in `question_field_mapping`
- Visible to admins in Question Bank Manager
- Can be edited, activated/deactivated, or deleted by admins

## üìä Field-Based Question Distribution

### STEM (35% Coding, 25% Logic, 25% Math)
- Heavy focus on technical skills
- Programming and problem-solving emphasis
- Moderate difficulty distribution (25% easy, 50% medium, 25% hard)

### Business (30% Logic, 25% Current Affairs, 20% Language)
- Business reasoning and communication focus
- Current events and market awareness
- Slightly easier distribution (30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard)

### Social Sciences (30% Language, 25% Culture, 20% Current Affairs)
- Communication and cultural understanding
- Social awareness and analysis
- Easier distribution (35% easy, 45% medium, 20% hard)

### Health & Medicine (30% Logic, 20% Current Affairs, 20% Language)
- Medical reasoning and communication
- Healthcare awareness
- Balanced distribution (30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard)

### Creative Arts (35% Language, 25% Culture, 15% Vedic Knowledge)
- Creative expression and cultural understanding
- Artistic and literary focus
- Easier distribution (35% easy, 45% medium, 20% hard)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Field Detection
```javascript
// Prioritizes background selection over text analysis
function detectStudyFieldFromBackground(studentData) {
  // 1. Check background_field_of_study (direct mapping)
  if (studentData.background_field_of_study) {
    return fieldMapping[studentData.background_field_of_study];
  }
  
  // 2. Fallback to keyword analysis of all student data
  // Including intake responses, skills, interests, goals
}
```

### Question Generation Flow
```javascript
// 1. Get admin questions mapped to field
const adminQuestions = await getFieldMappedQuestions(field, category, difficulty);

// 2. Generate remaining with AI
const aiQuestions = await grokService.generateUniqueQuestions(...);

// 3. Persist AI questions for admin visibility
await storeGeneratedQuestions(aiQuestions, field, category, difficulty);

// 4. Combine and return
return [...adminQuestions, ...aiQuestions];
```

### Route Protection
```jsx
// Background selection enforced before intake/assignment
<Route path="intake" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <BackgroundSelectionWrapper>
      <StudentRedirect>
        <Intake />
      </StudentRedirect>
    </BackgroundSelectionWrapper>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## üé® Admin Experience

### Question Bank Manager
- View all questions (admin-created + AI-generated)
- Filter by category, difficulty, created_by
- Edit, activate/deactivate, delete questions
- See AI-generated questions with `created_by='ai'` tag
- Questions automatically mapped to fields for targeted assessments

### Student Analytics
- View student progress by field
- See question performance statistics
- Track field-based assessment effectiveness

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the complete setup script in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: src/sql/complete_field_based_setup.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_TABLE=students
VITE_GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Go to `/intake` - should show background selection modal
2. Select field and complete intake form
3. Go to `/assignment` - should generate field-appropriate questions
4. Complete assignment and check results
5. Go to `/admin` -> Question Banks to see AI-generated questions
